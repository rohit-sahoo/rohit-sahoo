### 🔥 What I’ve Worked On

- 🧠 **AI for ESG & Regulation**  
  At **IFC, World Bank Group**, I developed **LLM-powered RAG pipelines** to extract insights from ESG documents, improving compliance and decision-making for regulatory stakeholders.

- 🚗 **Forecasting & AI Automation**  
  At **TCS**, I worked on large-scale **time series models**, **BERT-based NLP systems**, and **MLOps pipelines** for predictive modeling and automation in supply chain and automotive domains.

- 📊 **Academic Projects & Research**  
  - 🧾 [**ResearchLens**](https://github.com/rohit-sahoo/ResearchLens): Academic reading assistant using fine-tuned LLaMA 2, RAG, GAG, CRF-based NER, and citation retrieval  
  - 📄 [**Auto-Table-Extract**](https://github.com/rohit-sahoo/auto-table-extract): PDF table detection via clustering and unsupervised learning (**F1 score: 0.89**)
